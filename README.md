Christian Reyes, Carolina Barchecho, Roy Alkhoury, and Flora Luo contribute and maintain the project.
What the project does-
The product aims to use delivery robots in order to accomdate higher distance robotic deliveries as the market only has robots of up to 4 mph. It will be used for any deliveries such as groceries or even online deliveries.

Why the project is useful-
It will be useful due to the fact that there is no other company that has long distance robotic deliveries other than the robot taxi that is being tested out in San Francisco. By increasing the amount of distance, it would revolutionize the market as it would open opportunities for deliveries late in to the night where it would otherwise be deemed unsafe for a delivery.
